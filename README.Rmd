## Overview

`kuzuR` provides an R interface to the [Kuzu Graph Database](https://kuzudb.com/), a high-performance, embedded graph database. The package acts as a wrapper around the official Python `kuzu` client, using the `reticulate` package to bridge the two languages. This allows you to interact with Kuzu seamlessly within your R environment, integrating its powerful graph computation capabilities into your existing data analysis workflows.

The primary goal of `kuzuR` is to provide an idiomatic R experience for: - Creating and managing Kuzu database instances. - Executing Cypher queries. - Loading data from and retrieving results into R data frames and tibbles. - Converting graph query results directly into R-native graph objects like `igraph` and `tidygraph`.

## Installation

`kuzuR` requires a working Python installation. Once Python is available, you can install the package and its Python dependencies in two steps.

1.  **Install the R package** from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("WickM/kuzuR")
```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:** Use the built-in helper function to install `kuzu`, `pandas`, and `networkx` into a dedicated environment.

``` r
library(kuzuR)
install_kuzu()
```

## Usage

Here is a complete example demonstrating how to create a database, define a schema, load data, and run queries.

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Plot of the graph structure created from Kuzu query results."}
library(kuzuR)
library(igraph)
library(tidygraph)
library(g6R)

# 1. Create a database in a temporary directory
db_path <- tempfile()
con <- kuzu_connection(db_path)

# 2. Define a schema
# Create a 'Person' node table with a STRING name and INT64 age
schema_query_1 <- "CREATE NODE TABLE Person (
  name STRING,
  age INT64,
  PRIMARY KEY (name)
)"
kuzu_execute(con, schema_query_1)

# Create a 'Knows' relationship table
schema_query_2 <- "CREATE REL TABLE Knows(FROM Person TO Person, since INT64)"
kuzu_execute(con, schema_query_2)

# 3. Load data from R data frames
# Create node data
nodes <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Carol"),
  age = c(30, 40, 50)
)

# Create edge data
edges <- data.frame(
  from_person = c("Alice", "Bob"),
  to_person = c("Bob", "Carol"),
  since = c(2010, 2015)
)

# Use kuzu_copy_from_df to load the data
kuzu_copy_from_df(con, "Person", nodes)
# Rename columns to match Kuzu's expected FROM/TO for relationships
names(edges) <- c("FROM", "TO", "since")
kuzu_copy_from_df(con, "Knows", edges)

# 4. Execute Cypher queries
# Retrieve data as a data frame
query_result <- kuzu_execute(con, "MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p.name, p.age")
as.data.frame(query_result)

# 5. Convert graph results to R objects
# The same query result can be converted into different graph formats.
graph_result <- kuzu_execute(con, "MATCH (a:Person)-[k:Knows]->(b:Person) RETURN a, k, b")

# a) Convert to an igraph object
g_igraph <- as_igraph(graph_result)
print(g_igraph)
plot(g_igraph)

# b) Convert to a tidygraph object
g_tidy <- as_tidygraph(graph_result)
print(g_tidy)

# c) Convert to a g6R object for interactive plotting
# Note: This will render as an interactive plot in HTML outputs.
g_g6 <- as_g6R(graph_result)
g_g6

# 6. Inspecting Query Results
# You can inspect the schema of a query result without converting it to a data frame.
# Get column names
kuzu_get_column_names(query_result)

# Get column data types
kuzu_get_column_data_types(query_result)

# Get the full schema as a named list
kuzu_get_schema(query_result)
```

## Learning and Getting Help

This package is currently **experimental**. The core API is subject to change as we work towards a stable release.

-   For more detailed examples and workflows, please see the package vignettes (coming soon).
-   If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/WickM/kuzuR/issues).
