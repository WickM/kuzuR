Description: A high-performance R interface to the Kuzu graph database.
    This package uses the 'reticulate' package to wrap the official Python
    client ('kuzu', 'pandas', and 'networkx'), allowing users to interact
    with Kuzu seamlessly from within R.
    Key features include managing database connections, executing Cypher
    queries, and efficiently loading data from R data frames. It also
    provides seamless integration with the R ecosystem by converting query
    results directly into popular R data structures, including 'tibble',
    'igraph', 'tidygraph', and 'g6R' objects, making Kuzu's powerful graph
    computation capabilities readily available for data analysis and
    visualization workflows in R.
