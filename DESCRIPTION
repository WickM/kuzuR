Description: Provides a high-performance 'R' interface to the 'kuzu' graph database.
    It uses the 'reticulate' package to wrap the official 'Python' client
    ('kuzu', 'pandas', and 'networkx'), allowing users to interact with 'kuzu'
    seamlessly from within 'R'. Key features include managing database
    connections, executing 'Cypher' queries, and efficiently loading data from
    'R' data frames. It also provides seamless integration with the 'R' ecosystem
    by converting query results directly into popular 'R' data structures,
    including 'tibble', 'igraph', 'tidygraph', and 'g6R' objects, making
    'kuzu's powerful graph computation capabilities readily available for data
    analysis and visualization workflows in 'R'.
    The 'kuzu' documentation can be found at <https://kuzudb.github.io/docs/>.
