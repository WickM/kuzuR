## R CMD check results

There are no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There is one NOTE regarding the license stub. I have ensured that the `DESCRIPTION` file specifies `License: MIT + file LICENSE` and that the `LICENSE` file contains the standard MIT license text.

The `pdflatex` error during the check is a local environment issue and should not affect the package's integrity on CRAN.
