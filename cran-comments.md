## Resubmission

This is a resubmission of `kuzuR`. The version has been bumped to `0.2.0` due to a breaking change where the `install_kuzu()` function was replaced with `check_kuzu_installation()` to give users more control over their Python environment.

Other changes in this version include a fix for a timezone-related test failure and the addition of standard GitHub Actions for R CMD checks.

## R CMD check results

There are no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.
