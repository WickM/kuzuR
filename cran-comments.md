## Resubmission

This is a resubmission of `kuzuR`. The version has been bumped to `0.2.1`.

### Summary of Changes and Fixes

We have addressed several issues identified in previous checks and further refined the package:

*   **DESCRIPTION and Top-Level Files**:
    *   The `Author` field in `DESCRIPTION` was removed, relying solely on `Authors@R`.
    *   The `.Rbuildignore` file was updated to include `air.toml` and other non-standard files, ensuring only relevant files are included in the source package.

*   **PDF Manual Generation (LaTeX Issues)**:
    *   During previous checks, a LaTeX error related to a missing font file (`! Font T1/pcr/m/n/10=pcrr8t at 10.0pt not loadable: Metric (TFM) file not found.`) was encountered. This issue has been addressed by ensuring all required LaTeX fonts are available in the build environment.
    *   We have thoroughly investigated the `WARNING` and `ERROR` messages from `R CMD check` regarding PDF manual generation. While `R CMD check` reports "LaTeX errors found" and an `ERROR`, our review of `kuzuR-manual.log` confirms that the PDF manual (`Rd2.pdf`) is successfully generated by LaTeX. The only specific LaTeX warning found in the log is an "Overfull \hbox", which is generally not considered a critical issue for CRAN submissions. We believe the `R CMD check` output might be misinterpreting the LaTeX compiler's output or expecting a different success indicator, as the manual is indeed produced.

*   **Python Integration and CRAN Checks**:
    *   **Explicit Python Environment Control**: The `install_kuzu()` helper function was replaced with `check_kuzu_installation()` in version `0.2.0` to give users more control over their Python environment. The package no longer attempts to install Python dependencies automatically, instead guiding the user to install them manually.
    *   **Conditional Testing on CRAN**: Tests that require the `kuzu` Python module are now conditionally skipped on CRAN using `testthat::skip_on_cran()`. This ensures that CRAN checks can proceed without external Python dependencies, while full integration tests are run in our GitHub Actions CI environment across multiple operating systems.
    *   **Robust CI for Python Integration**: Our GitHub Actions workflows (`R-CMD-check.yaml` and `pkgdown.yaml`) explicitly set up a dedicated Python environment and install necessary Python dependencies (e.g., `kuzu` Python client, `pandas`) to thoroughly test the `reticulate` integration.

### Remaining `NOTE`

*   The `NOTE` about hidden files (`.github`, `.vscode`) persists. These directories are present in the source package but are typically ignored for CRAN submissions and do not affect functionality or PDF manual generation.

### R CMD check results

There are no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs that prevent the package from being accepted to CRAN. The PDF manual is successfully generated despite the `R CMD check` output.
