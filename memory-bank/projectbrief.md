# Project Brief: kuzuR

## Core Requirements and Goals

The primary goal of the `kuzuR` project is to create an R package that provides a robust and user-friendly interface to the Kuzu graph database engine.

This involves:
- **Connecting to Kuzu:** Establishing and managing connections to a Kuzu database instance.
- **Database Operations:** Enabling core database operations from within R.
- **Query Execution:** Allowing users to execute Cypher queries against the Kuzu database and retrieve results.
- **Data Integration:** Seamlessly integrating Kuzu query results into common R data structures like DataFrames and Tibbles, as well as providing direct conversion to R's most popular graph objects (`igraph`, `tidygraph`, etc.).

## Scope

The project focuses on providing a direct interface to Kuzu's functionality, making it accessible to R users for graph data analysis and manipulation. The package should be well-documented and easy to install and use.
