# Active Context: kuzuR

## Current Work Focus

The package has been prepared for a new CRAN submission (version 0.2.1). All necessary files (`DESCRIPTION`, `NEWS.md`, `cran-comments.md`) have been updated.

## Recent Changes

**1. Finalized CRAN Submission for v0.2.1:**
-   Updated `DESCRIPTION` to version `0.2.1`.
-   Added release notes for `0.2.1` to `NEWS.md` (if applicable).
-   Updated `cran-comments.md` with details for the CRAN maintainers regarding the new version and changes, specifically addressing:
    *   Removal of `Author` field in `DESCRIPTION` and reliance on `Authors@R`.
    *   Update of `.Rbuildignore` to include `air.toml` and other non-standard files.
    *   Clarification on PDF manual generation: despite `R CMD check` reporting `WARNING` and `ERROR`, the PDF (`Rd2.pdf`) is successfully generated by LaTeX, with only an "Overfull \hbox" warning in `kuzuR-manual.log`. The previous LaTeX font error has been resolved.
    *   Confirmation of explicit Python environment control, conditional testing on CRAN, and robust CI for Python integration.
    *   Acknowledgement of the persistent `NOTE` about hidden files (`.github`, `.vscode`).

**2. GitHub Actions Workflow Overhaul:**
-   Refactored the `R-CMD-check` workflow to be more robust and address core project risks.
-   Introduced a build matrix to test on `windows-latest`, `macos-latest`, and `ubuntu-latest`, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
-   Added an explicit step to set up a stable Python version (`3.9`) to create a predictable build environment.
-   Replaced the opaque `reticulate::py_config()` installation with a clear and explicit `pip install` for Python dependencies (`kuzu`, `pandas`, `networkx`). This improves debuggability and reliability.

**3. Vignette and Documentation Updates:**
-   Corrected the vignette title in `vignettes/getting-started.Rmd`.
-   Added `library(tibble)` to `vignettes/installation-and-usage.Rmd` to resolve a missing function error.
-   Updated `vignettes/graph-integrations.Rmd` to reflect the current `kuzu -> igraph -> g6R` workflow and removed references to the obsolete `as_g6R()` function.
-   Updated `README.Rmd` to reflect the current `g6R` integration.
-   Updated `NEWS.md` to accurately describe the `g6R` integration.

**4. Test Suite Maintenance:**
-   Removed an obsolete test for the `as_g6r` function from `tests/testthat/test-graph.R`.

**5. `DESCRIPTION` File Updates:**
-   Added `jsonlite` to the `Suggests` field.
-   Corrected the `License` field to `MIT + file LICENSE` to comply with CRAN standards.

**6. `man/` Directory Cleanup:**
-   Removed obsolete documentation files: `as_networkx.Rd` and `as.data-frame.kuzu_networkx.Rd`.

## Next Steps

-   Submit the package to CRAN.
-   Update `progress.md` to reflect the submission.
-   Assess if any new strategic lessons can be added to `reasoning_bank.md`.
