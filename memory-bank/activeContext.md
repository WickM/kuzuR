# Active Context: kuzuR

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus of this session was the implementation and subsequent refactoring of a major new feature: converting Kuzu query results into R-native graph objects.

## Recent Changes

**1. Feature Implementation: Graph Conversion**
-   **Initial Implementation:** First created a feature to convert Kuzu data to `igraph`, `tidygraph`, and `g6R` objects by manually querying and assembling nodes and edges.
-   **Iterative Debugging:** This initial approach proved fragile. Based on user feedback and test failures, we debugged a series of cascading errors related to Cypher syntax (`CALL ... WHERE`), internal ID access (`_id`), and object structure assumptions.
-   **Final Design (Major Refactor):** In response to the failures, the entire feature was redesigned to be more robust and align with best practices, following explicit user guidance.
    -   The new design is centered on `kuzu_execute()` -> `as_networkx()` -> `as.data.frame()`, which uses the official Python `get_as_networkx()` method.
    -   This delegates the complex conversion logic to the Kuzu and `networkx` libraries and provides a clean, stable foundation.
-   **Testing:** Implemented a new test suite (`tests/testthat/test-graph.R`) and iteratively corrected it to accurately validate the final, correct implementation.

**2. Documentation & Process Improvement**
-   **Improved Documentation:** Significantly improved the `roxygen2` documentation for the new functions, providing detailed explanations and runnable examples.
-   **Memory Bank Update:** Updated all memory bank files to reflect the new feature, the superior S3-based design pattern, the `networkx` dependency, and updated project status.
-   **New Directive:** Added a new core principle to the memory bank: "When encountering a persistent bug... prioritize asking the user for help".
-   **Dependency Management:** Corrected the handling of Python dependencies, moving `networkx` from `DESCRIPTION` to the `install_kuzu()` helper function.
-   **Housekeeping:** Added the `memory-bank/` directory to `.Rbuildignore`.
-   **Clarification (from user feedback):** Updated `techContext.md` and `systemPatterns.md` to document the C++ toolchain incompatibility (MSVC vs. MinGW) that necessitated the use of the `reticulate` wrapper pattern.
-   Initialized the `memory-bank` directory and all core files.

## Next Steps

-   The highest priority is creating a vignette to document the new graph conversion feature.
-   Consider adding support for more graph libraries if needed.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

-   **Problem-Solving:** When encountering a persistent bug or a lack of clarity about an external library's object structure, do not guess repeatedly. After two failed attempts, prioritize asking the user for help, for example by requesting the output of a command like `str()` to reveal an object's structure.
-   **Function Design:** Focus on function separation. Avoid creating "do-everything" functions. Instead, compose small, single-purpose functions into a larger workflow. This promotes modularity, reusability, and easier testing.
-   **Architecture:** The project follows a `reticulate`-based wrapper pattern. All new R functions that interface with the database should follow this established pattern of calling Python via `py_run_string`.
-   **Documentation:** Functions must be documented with high-quality `roxygen2`-style comments. Descriptions should be clear, detailed, and adhere to R's documentation best practices. Every exported function should include a runnable example in its `@examples` tag.
-   **User Experience:** The primary goal is a seamless R user experience. Abstractions should hide Python-specific details wherever possible. S3 methods should be used for type conversion to familiar R objects (`data.frame`, `tibble`).
