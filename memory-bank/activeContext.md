# Active Context: kuzuR

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on finalizing the `kuzuR` package for CRAN submission. This includes ensuring all documentation is accurate, tests are passing, and the package is compliant with CRAN policies.

## Recent Changes

**1. Vignette and Documentation Updates:**
-   Corrected the vignette title in `vignettes/getting-started.Rmd`.
-   Added `library(tibble)` to `vignettes/installation-and-usage.Rmd` to resolve a missing function error.
-   Updated `vignettes/graph-integrations.Rmd` to reflect the current `kuzu -> igraph -> g6R` workflow and removed references to the obsolete `as_g6R()` function.
-   Updated `README.Rmd` to reflect the current `g6R` integration.
-   Updated `NEWS.md` to accurately describe the `g6R` integration.

**2. Test Suite Maintenance:**
-   Removed an obsolete test for the `as_g6r` function from `tests/testthat/test-graph.R`.

**3. `DESCRIPTION` File Updates:**
-   Added `jsonlite` to the `Suggests` field.
-   Corrected the `License` field to `MIT + file LICENSE` to comply with CRAN standards.

**4. `man/` Directory Cleanup:**
-   Removed obsolete documentation files: `as_networkx.Rd` and `as.data-frame.kuzu_networkx.Rd`.

**5. `cran-comments.md` Update:**
-   Updated the `cran-comments.md` file to provide context for the CRAN maintainers regarding the submission.

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps are to complete the final checks and then update the remaining memory bank files.

-   Run `R CMD check` one last time to ensure all issues are resolved.
-   Update `progress.md` to reflect the current status of the project.
-   Assess if any new strategic lessons can be added to `reasoning_bank.md`.
