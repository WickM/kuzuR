### Current Focus: Solidifying Memory Bank Protocol

The immediate priority is to formalize the new, more robust memory bank protocol we've just designed. This involves updating the project's internal rule-set to reflect the principles of append-only logging, explicit consolidation triggers, and staged validation for new strategic reasoning.

### Recent Changes & Next Steps

1.  **[Done]** Collaboratively stress-tested the existing `memorybank.md` protocol and identified key weaknesses (risk of overwriting, subjective triggers, potential for flawed reasoning).
2.  **[Done]** Drafted a new, robust memory consolidation protocol to address these weaknesses.
3.  **[Done]** Added the lesson learned from this process as a `[PROPOSED REASONING UNIT]` to this file for future validation.
4.  **[Done]** User validated the proposed reasoning unit.
5.  **[Done]** Moved the new reasoning unit to `reasoning_bank.md`.
6.  **[Next]** All tasks related to the memory bank protocol update are complete.
