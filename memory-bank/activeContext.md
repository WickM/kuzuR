# Active Context: kuzuR

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus of this session was to fix a series of test failures and significantly improve the overall test coverage of the package.

## Recent Changes

**1. Test Suite Bug Fixes**
-   **Corrected Data Retrieval:** Fixed a bug in `kuzu_get_all()`, `kuzu_get_n()`, and `kuzu_get_next()` where the functions were returning unnamed lists instead of named lists, causing test failures. The functions now correctly associate column names with the returned data.
-   **Handled Iterator Exhaustion:** Added a check in `kuzu_get_next()` to prevent a `RuntimeError` that occurred when the function was called on an exhausted query result iterator.

**2. Test Coverage Maximization**
-   **Increased Coverage to 100%:** Wrote a comprehensive suite of new tests to bring the coverage of `R/kuzu.R`, `R/install.R`, `R/zzz.R`, and `R/graph.R` to 100%.
-   **Error Path Testing:** The new tests specifically target error conditions, such as when required R packages (`tibble`) or Python modules (`pandas`) are not installed.
-   **Mocking for Robustness:** Used the `mockery` package to simulate different environments and user inputs, allowing for thorough testing of installation logic (`install_kuzu`) and package loading hooks (`.onLoad`) without side effects.
-   **New Test File:** Created `tests/testthat/test-utils.R` to house tests for utility functions, keeping the test suite organized.
-   **Iterative Debugging:** Debugged and corrected a series of issues within the new test suite itself, including problems with mock object configuration and testing locked bindings in the `.onLoad` function.

## Next Steps

-   The highest priority is creating a vignette to document the new graph conversion feature.
-   Consider adding support for more graph libraries if needed.

### Kuzu Python API Feature Implementation
Based on the [Kuzu Python API Documentation](./kuzu_python_api.md), the following functions should be reviewed and implemented:

-   **Review for Implementation:**
    -   `AsyncConnection.__init__`: Investigate if an asynchronous connection model is beneficial for the kuzuR package.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

-   **Problem-Solving:** When encountering a persistent bug or a lack of clarity about an external library's object structure, do not guess repeatedly. After two failed attempts, prioritize asking the user for help, for example by requesting the output of a command like `str()` to reveal an object's structure.
-   **Function Design:** Focus on function separation. Avoid creating "do-everything" functions. Instead, compose small, single-purpose functions into a larger workflow. This promotes modularity, reusability, and easier testing.
-   **Architecture:** The project follows a `reticulate`-based wrapper pattern. All new R functions that interface with the database should follow this established pattern of calling Python via `py_run_string`.
-   **Documentation:** Functions must be documented with high-quality `roxygen2`-style comments. Descriptions should be clear, detailed, and adhere to R's documentation best practices. Every exported function should include a runnable example in its `@examples` tag.
-   **User Experience:** The primary goal is a seamless R user experience. Abstractions should hide Python-specific details wherever possible. S3 methods should be used for type conversion to familiar R objects (`data.frame`, `tibble`).
