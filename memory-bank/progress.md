# Progress: kuzuR

## What Works

-   **Graph Integrations:** A robust, S3-based system for converting Kuzu query results into R graph objects.
    -   The workflow is `kuzu_execute() -> as_igraph() -> as_tidygraph()` or `g6_igraph()`.
    -   Supports `igraph`, `tidygraph`, and `g6R`.
    -   This feature is now covered by a `testthat` suite.
-   **Core Database Operations:**
    -   Simplified database connection and management (`kuzu_connection`).
    -   Query execution (`kuzu_execute`).
    -   Data loading from `data.frame`s (`kuzu_copy_from_df`).
    -   Result retrieval and conversion to `data.frame` and `tibble`.
-   **Complete Test Suite:** The test suite is comprehensive and covers all core functionality.
-   **Vignette and Documentation Updates:** All vignettes and the `README.Rmd` have been updated to reflect the current state of the package.
-   **CRAN Compliance:** Most `R CMD check` issues have been resolved. The remaining issues are a system-level `pdflatex` error and a persistent but likely benign NOTE about the license stub.

## What's Left to Build
-   **CRAN Submission Checklist:**
    1.  Review and Enhance Documentation: Ensure all exported functions have complete and runnable examples, and review all documentation for clarity.
    **CSV Import Options:** Document CSV import options (HEADER, DELIM, QUOTE, ESCAPE, SKIP, PARALLEL, IGNORE_ERRORS, auto_detect, sample_size, NULL_STRINGS, Compressed CSV files).
-   **UDF (User-Defined Functions):** Investigate and implement support for Kuzu's user-defined functions.
-   **ellmer Graph RAG Tool Implementation:** Implement the `ellmer` tool for Graph RAG (post-CRAN submission).

## Known Issues

-   **Data Type Support:** There are known issues with `Decimal` and `uuid` data types that require a workaround. This will be addressed in a future development cycle.
-   **`pdflatex` not found:** This is a system-level issue that prevents the PDF manual from being built. It does not affect the package's functionality.

## Current Status

The project is at a **beta** stage. The core functionality is stable and well-tested. The documentation has been updated, and the package is nearly ready for CRAN submission. The remaining tasks are primarily related to the CRAN submission process and future feature enhancements.
