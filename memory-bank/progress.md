# Progress: kuzuR

## What Works

-   **Graph Integrations:** A robust, S3-based system for converting Kuzu query results into R graph objects.
    -   The workflow is `kuzu_execute() -> as_networkx() -> as.data.frame() -> as_igraph()`.
    -   Supports `igraph`, `tidygraph`, and `g6R`.
    -   This feature is now covered by a `testthat` suite.
-   **Core Database Operations:**
    -   Simplified database connection and management (`kuzu_connection`).
    -   Query execution (`kuzu_execute`).
    -   Data loading from `data.frame`s (`kuzu_copy_from_df`).
    -   Result retrieval and conversion to `data.frame` and `tibble`.
-   **Complete Test Suite:** The remaining 5 tests have been finalized, ensuring full coverage.
-   **R CMD Check Resolution:** All `ERROR`s, `WARNING`s, and `NOTE`s from `R CMD check --as-cran` have been successfully resolved. This included:
    -   Moving `g6R`, `tibble`, and `tidygraph` from `Suggests` to `Imports` in `DESCRIPTION`.
    -   Correcting a file path issue in `tests/testthat/test-kuzu_load_data.R` by replacing `here::here()` with `test_path()`.
    -   Adding `memory_prompt.md` to `.Rbuildignore`.
    -   Refactoring `R/zzz.R` to use `.onAttach` for startup messages.
    -   Shortening long lines in documentation examples.
-   **OverflowError Resolution:** The persistent `OverflowError` related to `reticulate` object round-trips has been resolved by refactoring connection logic to keep Python objects within the Python environment.
-   **Graph Integrations Vignette:** The `graph-integrations.Rmd` vignette has been created, demonstrating a complete analysis workflow using the new graph conversion functions.

## What's Left to Build
-   **CRAN Submission Checklist:**
    1.  Review and Enhance Documentation: Ensure all exported functions have complete and runnable examples, and review all documentation for clarity. (Still pending, `README.md` indicates vignettes are "coming soon" and more detailed examples are needed.)
    2.  Ensure Package Description Acknowledges Original Authors: State clearly in `DESCRIPTION` and `README.md` that `kuzuR` builds upon the work of Kuzu and g6R authors. (Still pending, explicit acknowledgment of building upon Kuzu and g6R authors is missing in both files.)
    3.  Email Kuzu and G6R Authors: Inform them about the `kuzuR` package before CRAN submission.
    4.  Create GitHub Pages for Documentation: Set up GitHub Pages for hosting package documentation using `pkgdown` and GitHub Actions.
-   **CSV Import Options:** Document CSV import options (HEADER, DELIM, QUOTE, ESCAPE, SKIP, PARALLEL, IGNORE_ERRORS, auto_detect, sample_size, NULL_STRINGS, Compressed CSV files). (Still pending, `kuzu_copy_from_csv` requires further logic to translate optional parameters into Kuzu `COPY` options.)
-   **UDF (User-Defined Functions):** Investigate and implement support for Kuzu's user-defined functions. (Still pending, a `TODO UDF` exists in `R/kuzu.R`.)
-   **Handle Python Dependencies Gracefully:** `install_kuzu()` has been reviewed and appears to handle Python dependencies gracefully, providing options for installation into new or existing environments.
-   **Strengthen Testing:** Test coverage for all core functionality has been reviewed and expanded, with dedicated test files (`test-graph.R`, `test-kuzu_load_data.R`, `test-kuzu.R`) ensuring robustness.
-   **Broader Graph Support:** While the core framework is in place, we could add direct conversion wrappers for other popular graph libraries if requested.
-   **Advanced Kuzu Features:** The core package could still be extended to support more advanced Kuzu features (e.g., transaction management).
-   **ellmer Graph RAG Tool Implementation:** Implement the `ellmer` tool for Graph RAG (post-CRAN submission).
-   **Fix GitHub Actions:** Address any issues with GitHub Actions workflows.
-   **Configure Codecov and Lintr:** Set up and configure Codecov for code coverage and Lintr for code style checking.
-   **Manually Inspect Code Examples:** Perform a final manual inspection of all code examples for validity and correctness.

## Known Issues

-   **Data Type Support:** There are known issues with `Decimal` and `uuid` data types that require a workaround. This will be addressed in a future development cycle.

## Current Status

The project is at an **alpha** stage. The core functionality is present and is now supported by a comprehensive test suite, significantly increasing its robustness. The test suite is now complete, and all `R CMD check` issues have been resolved. The memory bank has been fully reviewed and synchronized. The immediate next steps are focused on preparing for CRAN submission, particularly improving user-facing documentation and addressing the CRAN checklist items.
